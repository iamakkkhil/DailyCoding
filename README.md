## DAY 1: Exactly 3 Divisors.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numbers-exactly-3-divisors/

**QUESTION** : Given a number N, print all numbers in the range from 1 to N having 
exactly 3 divisors.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N1/2 * N1/4) <br />
Expected Auxilliary Space :  O(1)

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## DAY 2: Modular Multiplicative Inverse.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiplicative-inverse-under-modulo-m/

**QUESTION** : Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’. The task is to find the smallest modular 
multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’. If the modular multiplicative inverse 
doesn't exist return -1.

Expected Time Complexity : O(m) <br />
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints: <br />
1 <= a <= 10<sup>4</sup> <br />
1 <= m <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## DAY 3: First Repeating Element.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-repeating-element-array-integers/

**QUESTION** : Given an array of integers, find the first repeating element in it. We need 
to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence 
is smallest. If there is no such element, return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN) <br />
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(N)

Constraints: <br />
1 <= N <= 10<sup>6</sup> <br />
0 <= Ai<= 10<sup>6</sup>

## DAY 4: Rearrange an array with O(1) extra space.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-given-array-place/

**QUESTION** : Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in the range 
from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].

Expected Time Complexity: O(N) <br />
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints: <br />
1 <= N <= 10<sup>7</sup> <br />
0 <= Lst[i] < N
