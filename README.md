## DAY 1:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numbers-exactly-3-divisors/

QUESTION : Given a number N, print all numbers in the range from 1 to N having 
exactly 3 divisors.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N1/2 * N1/4) <br />
Expected Auxilliary Space :  O(1)

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10**9


## DAY 2:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiplicative-inverse-under-modulo-m/

QUESTION : Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’. The task is to find the smallest modular 
multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’. If the modular multiplicative inverse 
doesn't exist return -1.

Expected Time Complexity : O(m) <br />
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= a <= 10**4 <br />
1 <= m <= 10**4
